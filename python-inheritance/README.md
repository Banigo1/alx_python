## Python | Inheritance

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. The class that inherits from another class is called the `subclass` or `derived class,` and the class being inherited from is called the `superclass` or `base class.`

Inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, where the subclasses can reuse and extend the functionality of the superclass. This promotes code reusability and helps in organizing code into logical and manageable units.

Inheritance allows us to define common behaviors in the superclass and customize or extend them in the subclasses, making our code more organized and maintainable.
